Purpose: Recompute which faction owns each tile of the map, and rebuild every
         per-faction and per-region tally that ownership feeds.
Original Offset: 00523DD0
Return Value: n/a
Status: Complete

Ownership is decided by proximity: the nearest base within
Rules->territory_max_dist_base owns the tile, and an OCEAN tile halves that
distance and is then overruled outright by any base in its own eight-tile
ring - which is how coastal water ends up belonging to the base beside it
rather than to a larger one further off. A tile with no base in range is
unclaimed, which the map stores as -1.

Everything else here is tallies. Six per-region arrays are zeroed for all eight
factions before the walk, and the walk refills them:

  - unk_79[region] counts tiles the faction can see in that region - or, for a
    faction whose AI is running the objectives strategy, tiles carrying
    BIT_SUPPLY_REMOVE instead. That substitution is what PFLAG_STRAT_SEARCH_-
    OBJECTIVES selects, and it is a substitution rather than an addition.
  - unk_78[region] counts tiles the faction owns; unclaimed tiles count for
    faction zero.
  - unk_80[region] counts owned tiles that are wet, not rocky and not fungus,
    and unk_81[region] the subset of those already inside a base radius.
  - unk_82[region] is the best world_site score the faction owns there, and
    unk_83[region] the supply pods on its tiles.

Continents[region] gets the same last two facts for the region as a whole, in
unk_3 and pods, which is what those two field comments already say.

The walk is the same shape as num_objectives': one Map entry per tile visited,
never reset between rows, starting each row at `x = y & 1`. An empty row - one
where the start is already past MapLongitudeBounds - does not advance the
pointer at all.

A tile inside a base radius is not scored as a site and is not asked to be: its
score is taken as zero without reading val2. Elsewhere the stored score is used
if there is one and world_site() is called and the answer cached with
site_set() if there is not, so a full map walk costs at most one scoring pass
per tile ever.

The supply-pod arm ends in a site request, and its two branches are not
symmetric. An owned tile asks only its owner; an unclaimed one asks every
faction that has a base in the region, and each of those must additionally not
already hold a site here and must have a base at between one and two times the
territory distance - near enough to want it, far enough not to have it already.
Both branches require the faction either to see the tile or to be an AI above
difficulty 3, which is the standard "the AI is allowed to know" test.

Purpose: Run the repair phase for the specified faction: reset the per-turn unit state, heal every

Return Value: n/a
Status: Complete

TWO PASSES OVER THE UNIT TABLE, NOT ONE. The first heals; the second redraws. They cannot be
folded together, because the first pass can retire a Fungal Tower's owner (below) and the second
pass filters on the faction byte the first one may have just rewritten.

WHAT "REPAIR RATE" MEANS. The rate is a count of repair points, and the damage actually removed is
`reactor_id * rate` - a Fission unit (reactor 1) removes one point per rate step, a Singularity
unit (reactor 4) removes four. The rate starts at 1 and is added to:

  +1  standing in your own territory
  +1  a land unit in a bunker, or an air unit on an airbase
  +1  standing in any base that is not rioting
  x2  a land transport carrying a unit with the Repair ability, at sea or under Sentry/Board

and it is replaced outright by the current damage - a full heal - when the base has the matching
repair facility for the unit's triad (Command Center / Naval Yard / Aerospace Complex) or the
faction holds the matching secret project (Command Nexus / Maritime Control Center / Cloudbase
Academy); when a native-life unit sits in a base whose faction has any lifecycle bonus at all
(`breed_mod`); or, anywhere on the map, when the faction holds the Nano Factory.

Native life in fungus is the one rate bonus that is not additive: it sets the rate to 2 rather
than incrementing it, and it is skipped entirely for a Fungal Tower.

MINIMUM DAMAGE. A unit in the field - non-native faction, not in a base, no repair unit in its
stack, no Nano Factory - cannot be healed below `reactor_id * 2`. Native life in fungus, and
anyone in fungus whose faction holds the Xenoempathy Dome, are exempt; the Dome additionally adds
one more reactor's worth of healing.

Verification note: three tests in this body can never take their false branch and are transcribed
rather than deleted. NONE of them is a mutation-sweep survivor, and the distinction is worth
keeping straight: a test that is constant-true still yields a mutant that is not, so "unreachable"
here is a statement about faithfulness to the original, not a coverage gap being excused.

  - `owner >= 0` after `owner < MaxPlayerNum`, in both passes. This is `base_who()` inlined
    (0x00526152 and 0x00526755); the nibble is masked to 0xF before it is asked, so the sign test
    is constant. can_terraform carries the identical dead half for the identical reason. Mutating
    it to `> 0` is NOT constant - a base owned by faction 0 separates them - and the fixtures
    cover that in both passes.
  - `if (min_damage)` at 0x005265AF. min_damage is `reactor_id * 2`, so the guard is false exactly
    when reactor_id is zero - and with reactor_id zero every statement it guards is a no-op
    (`min_damage` is already 0 and the Dome adds `reactor_id`). The branch is in the original;
    removing it changes nothing, and the harness derives no mutant from it because it carries
    neither a literal nor a comparison.
  - `veh_top()` returning negative. The original inlines the stack walk here rather than calling
    0x00579920, because veh.cpp is a different translation unit; its `veh_id < 0` guard
    (0x005264A2) and the `top < 0` test that follows (0x005264CC) are both dead, since the
    argument is this loop's own index. Calling veh_top() rather than re-transcribing the walk is
    exact: the walk at 0x005264A8-0x005264C6 is instruction-for-instruction that function. The
    `stack_id >= 0` this leaves behind is still killable, and killed: unit 0 is a real unit.

The two mutants that DO survive are equivalences rather than gaps. Swapping the `facility_id` and
`project_id` declarations reorders two uninitialised locals that are both assigned before either
is read. Turning `repaired >= damage` into `repaired > damage` changes only the case where they
are already equal, where the guarded statement assigns a variable to itself.

Bug note: the Fungal Tower's owner is reset to faction 0 (the native-life AI) on every repair
phase of whichever faction currently owns it, at 0x005261AF, BEFORE the second pass filters on
the faction byte. A captured Fungal Tower therefore reverts to Planet and is then skipped by its
captor's own redraw pass in the same call. Transcribed as written.
