// ORIGINAL: 0x00541100 FILE
// DEFERRED: ~2920 instructions, same giant-dialog category as 0x005275B0:
//           constructs a `Popup` near entry (0x0054112B, ??0Popup) under an
//           SEH frame, then dispatches through many early-return paths, each
//           with its own inlined unwind sequence - call histogram shows 48x
//           ~Scroll, 47x ~FlatButton, 32x ~BasePop, 30x Popup::close, 24x
//           ~GraphicWin, 18x ~BaseButton destructor calls, consistent with
//           several FlatButton/Scroll widgets torn down on every exit edge.
//           The `Popup popup;` RAII lever applies, but resolving which
//           destructor call belongs to which frame-slot local (as for
//           0x005275B0) needs a full frame-map pass before a body can be
//           written faithfully rather than guessed.

 * Calling a method of the ORIGINAL image, which lives at a fixed address in
 * terranx.exe rather than anywhere this DLL can link against.
 *
 * These used to be spelled as free function pointers carrying the convention
 * by hand:
 *
 *     typedef void(__thiscall func_buffer_line)(Buffer *, int, int, int, int);
 *     func_buffer_line *BufferHLine = (func_buffer_line *)0x005E1A80;
 *     BufferHLine(this, a, b, c, d);
 *
 * cl 12.00.8168 - the compiler that built the original, and the only one
 * whose output can say whether a recovered body is right - reserves the
 * `__thiscall` keyword and refuses it (C4234). Disabling that warning is a
 * TRAP: it compiles, and the call it emits is
 *
 *     push d; push c; push b; push a; call ...; add esp, 0x10
 *
 * which is __cdecl. The receiver goes on the stack instead of into ECX and
 * the caller cleans a frame the callee already cleaned. Every seam into the
 * original image would corrupt the stack, silently, at runtime.
 *
 * A pointer-to-member IS thiscall, in every compiler, without naming the
 * convention at all. The same call becomes
 *
 *     typedef void (OriginalObject::*func_buffer_line)(int, int, int, int);
 *     func_buffer_line BufferHLine = original_method<func_buffer_line>(0x005E1A80);
 *     (ORIGINAL(this)->*BufferHLine)(a, b, c, d);
 *
 * and VC6 emits `mov ecx, this; push d..a; call` - the receiver in ECX and
 * the callee cleaning up, which is what the original expects. Measured
 * against the real compiler, not inferred.
 *
 * The object is `OriginalObject` rather than the real class because the
 * receiver is frequently only known as `void *`, and because the pointer
 * value is all that is ever needed - none of these methods is resolved
 * through this type.

// ---- callees, declared and never defined (a definition would be inlined) ----
//
// `static` ON A CALLEE IS DELIBERATE. A method whose
// mangled infix is `QAA` or `QAG` takes NO `this` -
// every argument is on the stack - so the call site is
// `Class::method(...)` with no object, and declared
// non-static that spelling is `C2352: illegal call of
// non-static member function`. It does change the
// mangling from QAA to SA, which matters only for the
// SUBJECT; a callee is reached by a relocation the
// comparison masks, so its mangling reaches nothing.
//
// THE class/struct KEY IS NOT A GUESS EITHER, and must
// not be `corrected` against the catalogue. MSVC
// mangles struct `U` and class `V`, six classes
// disagree with THEMSELVES in the catalogue, and the
// image carries no RTTI to settle it. Both objects are
// ours: `recovery_symbols.canonicalise_class_keys`
// rewrites the TARGET object with the same map this
// unit uses, so they agree by construction. Changing
// one side alone is what breaks it.
