// The VC6 dialect limits and the source-form rules used to live here.
// They are knowledge, not scaffolding, so they now live in the agent
// system prompt (mizuchi.yaml, plugins.claude-runner.systemPrompt),
// where they can be edited without regenerating anything and are in
// context from the first token rather than behind a file read. This
// emitter computes declarations; it does not carry lessons.

// `char`, NOT `signed char`. They are distinct MSVC types and mangle
// differently - D against C - and the catalogue's `int8` means the first:
// counted over every catalogued mangled name, `PAD` appears 508 times and
// `PAC` once. Spelling it `signed char` made 150 derived prototypes emit a
// symbol no target object holds. `int8_t` keeps its C meaning below; neither
// catalogue ever uses it.
