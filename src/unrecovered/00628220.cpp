// globals are bound to fixed addresses, because both are byte-visible

// The VC6 dialect limits and the source-form rules used to live here.
// They are knowledge, not scaffolding, so they now live in the agent
// system prompt (mizuchi.yaml, plugins.claude-runner.systemPrompt),
// where they can be edited without regenerating anything and are in
// context from the first token rather than behind a file read. This
// emitter computes declarations; it does not carry lessons.
